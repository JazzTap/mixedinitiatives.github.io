Welcome to Mixed Initiatives!

These are the notes of the Seabright Camerata, a loose working group of scholar-practitioners in expressive computation. Posts here might discuss anything within the remit of _computational media_, broadly construed; at minimum we expect that this will probably include such topics as generative methods, interactive narrative, computational creativity, videogames, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence.

Partly this is an experiment in group blogging akin to [Grand Text Auto](https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/), where several of our intellectual ancestors used to post. Partly it's a place to drop rough pieces of writing that are too long for a Twitter thread but too tentative for formal (academic) publication. And partly it's just another website, because we like websites and want there to be more of them.

This website is deliberately scrappy and the writing on it is deliberately sketchy. Don't take it too seriously.
