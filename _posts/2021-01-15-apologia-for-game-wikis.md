title: Apologia for Game Wikis
excerpt: "Who knows."

Some folks in the community Discord for my roguelike _Caves of Qud_ are leading an effort to write a [comprehensive wiki](https://cavesofqud.gamepedia.com/) for the game. This brings me an immense about of joy for reasons I hope to explore here. I recall my experiences with one of _Qud_'s biggest inspirations, the 90s roguelike _Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM)_, and how it was (successfully) pitched to me as a game "so complicated you need a guidebook just to play it!" I spent hours scrolling through the pages of that guidebook, in parallel to my playthroughs but also in tangent of them, first searching for solutions to my problems (_why was I crushed to death by my own luggage?_) then later browsing through catalogs of the game's enchantingly myriad secrets (_putting beeswax in your ears deafens you to the banshee's wail, but getting hit by a fireball trap melts the wax and re-exposes your ears_).

Amusingly, "so complicated you need a guidebook just to play it" reads as critique today: games are frequently judged by how self-contained they are, how effectively they encapsulate an experience inside the bounding box of their rules, how elegantly they unfurl their own secrets. The sort of game that does these things successfully will point to the gaps you're meant to fill: I might look at an _Into the Breach_ map and not immediately know the solution to the tactical puzzle there, but I know _what_ to solve and _how_ to solve it. Contrast this with an alternative tendency—what Jim Stormdancer called "games as ludic mystery"—where what is unknown is itself unknown. Instead of deriving theorems from axioms, we're discovering the axioms themselves.

_ADOM_ and its older sibling _Nethack_ are both games made in the tradition of ludic mystery. This lineage was broken with the distillation of roguelike mechanics that became popular over the last decade. I'm no purist — this new crop of games are interesting in their own right, and people should both play them and call them whatever they want. I'm just taking a moment to mourn an alternate path of genre popularity based on a neglected principle: it can be satisfying to be bewildered.
